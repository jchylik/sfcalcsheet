### Things that may or may not be implemented at some point: ###

* More elaborate model for planet surface temperature
  * Accounts for tidal heating
  * Accounts for internal heat sources, such as gravitational accretion in gas giants
  * Atmospheric pressure accounted for in greenhouse model, i.e. should be able to model Venus- and Mars-like worlds and super-earths
* Radiation belts and their effects on planetary habitability
* Ring system calculator (estimate from mass and particle density)
