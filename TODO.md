### Things that may or may not be implemented at some point: ###

* More elaborate model for planet surface temperature
  * Accounts for tidal heating
  * Accounts for internal heat sources, such as gravitational accretion in gas giants
  * Atmospheric pressure accounted for in greenhouse model, i.e. should be able to model Venus- and Mars-like worlds and super-earths
* Visible light vs. total radiative flux in planetary habitability calculator
* Radiation belts and their effects on lunar habitability
* Ring system calculator (estimate from mass and particle density)
  * **Done: “Ring system” calculator**
* Account for the age of a star when calculating its radius and luminosity
  * **Done: “Stellar evolution” calculator**
