### Things that may or may not be implemented at some point: ###

* Vegetation color calculator
  * Not much hard science on this, requires original research
  * Limited to aerobic land plants as the most visible ecosystem
  * Some simple-ish math on photosynthetic pigment absorption peaks in relation to the peak wavelength from the star
  * Output prevalence of individual pigments or leaf colors/shades rather than a single color
* More elaborate model for planet surface temperature
  * Accounts for tidal heating
  * Accounts for internal heat sources, such as gravitational accretion in gas giants
  * Atmospheric pressure accounted for in greenhouse model, i.e. should be able to model Venus- and Mars-like worlds and super-earths
* Radiation belts and their effects on planetary habitability
